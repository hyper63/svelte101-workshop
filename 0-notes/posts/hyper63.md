# About hyper63

hyper63 is a company founded in Charleston, SC in 2020 during the great pandemic, when everything went virtual or hyper! What is the last bit in a 64-bit collection? (hint: 63)

A different approach to software

## Our Mission it to

* Change the mindset of software developers
* Train/Grow software developers into solution providers
* Automate away the commons

## Changing the mindset of software developers

High performing teams ship to production hourly, focus on clear objectives and constantly deliver value to their customers. hyper63 believes every team and every developer can meet these objectives, but they have to change their mindset from fixed to growth. They have to focus in on what is important and isolate the churn and they have to be willing to wear multiple hats, designer, architect, engineer, developer, tester, support, product manager. Finally, they have to let go of the implementation details and focus on the business logic.

## Train and Grow software developers into solution providers

Once you have automated your flow you want to focus on your skill, get really good at the fundamentals, https, json, dom, apis, html, css, js. Learn how to isolate/separate your business rules from implemenation details. Future-proof your applications by building quality into the flow and creating strong loosely coupled boundaries between your implementation and your business logic leveraging indirection or dependency injection.

## Automate away the commons

Developers are constantly refining the commons, when the value is on the differentiation of the business, stop trying to find the best framework, best api tools, the best data tools, isolate your rules from the implementation and pick what you think is best now, by creating loosely coupled boundaries, it becomes easy to switch from one implementation to another over time. Ship code, use feature flags to create friction-less pathways from code -> review -> production.
